   - Chat will automatically connect to `localhost:11434`

2. **Production with Ollama**:
   - Set up Cloudflare Tunnel (see `scripts/start-permanent-tunnel.sh`)
   - Update `VITE_OLLAMA_URL` in `.env.production`

3. **OpenAI** (Alternative):
   - Set `VITE_USE_OPENAI=true`
   - Add your API key to environment variables

### API Integrations

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Chat Issues
- **"Too cheap" message**: Ollama server is offline or tunnel not running
- **API not connecting**: Check redirect URIs match exactly in API dashboards
- **Cache issues**: Use `./scripts/deploy-fresh.sh` for cache-busting deployment

### Development Issues
- **TypeScript errors**: Run `npm run lint` to check
- **Build failures**: Delete `node_modules` and `npm install` again
- **Port conflicts**: Ollama uses 11434, dev server uses 5173
